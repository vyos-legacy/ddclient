Yet again it's been a while but here is new release of ddclient. As usual,
there are some important changes and some documentation is modified.
A detailed overview can be found in git log but here's a quick overview:

	* added support for Yandex.Mail for Domain DNS service
	* added support for NearlyFreeSpeech.net
	* added support for DNS Made Easy
	* added systemd instructions
	* added support for dondominio.com
	* updated perl instruction
	* updated fritzbox instructions
	* fixed multidomain support for namecheap
	* fixed support for Yandex

A very big thank you for everyone who created a pull request on github and
for everyone who helped to fix the little issues caused by the new providers.
And a very special thank you for @DaveSophoServices who started to help with
the maintenance of ddclient.
